For businesses, understanding income distribution helps with talent acquisition, wage benchmarking, and employee retention strategies. Policymakers can use insights to develop targeted economic programs and initiatives. Additionally, individuals looking to improve their career prospects can benefit from knowing which factors (e.g., education, experience, work class) have the greatest impact on earnings.\n",

    "In this context the \"Income\" is the target variable that indicates whether an individual earns more or less than 50,000 annually. This is typically used to classify individuals into two income groups: those earning above 50K and those earning $50K or less. The income variable is crucial in determining economic outcomes and is used to understand the relationship between various demographic, educational, and professional characteristics and income levels.\n",

For the current data set, because Gaussian variables are used, we do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase."
