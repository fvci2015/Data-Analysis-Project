    "The mobile app industry, particularly the Google Play Store, is a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace where app developers, businesses, and marketers are constantly striving to create high-quality apps that meet user needs and preferences. With over 10,000 apps available across a wide range of categories, the challenge is not only to develop an app that users will love but also to ensure that it stands out in a crowded marketplace. Success in the app market is often determined by factors such as app quality, user ratings, number of reviews, category performance, and the pricing model (free vs. paid).\n",

However, without in-depth insights into the performance and trends within the Play Store, businesses may struggle to identify profitable niches, understand user preferences, or allocate resources efficiently."

However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase."
