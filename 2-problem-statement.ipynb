    "1. Data Understanding: Here, we need to load the data and understand the features present in it. This would help us choose the features that we will need for your final model.\n",

    "\n",

For the current data set, because Gaussian variables are used, we do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase."
